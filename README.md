THE SITUATION

I am a Business Intelligence Analyst at AdventureWorks, a global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories

THE BRIEF

The management team needs a way to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.

I have been given a folder of raw csv files, which contain information about transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories.

THE OBJECTIVE

I have to use Power BI Desktop to:

Connect and transform the raw data so that they can be accessed to build a data model

Build the relational data model 

Create calculated columns and measures with DAX and;

Lastly, design an interactive dashboard to visualize the data and use this model to generate meaningful insights.
