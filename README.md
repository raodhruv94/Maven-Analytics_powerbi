THE BRIEF

The management team at Adventure Works needs a data model to track the following KPIs: 
1. sales, revenue, profit, returns over the years,
2. compare regional performance,
3. analyze product-level trends and;
4. identify high-value customers.

My OBJECTIVE

I have been given a folder of raw csv files, which contain information about transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories.

I have to use Power BI Desktop to:

1. Connect and transform the raw data so that they can be accessed to build a data model

2. Build the relational data model that summarizes the above data 

3. Create calculated columns and measures with DAX and;

4. Lastly, design an interactive dashboard to visualize this data and use this model to generate meaningful insights.
