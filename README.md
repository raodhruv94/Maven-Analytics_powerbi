THE BRIEF

The management team at Adventure Works needs a data model to track the following KPIs: 
1. Sales, revenue, profit, returns over the years,
2. Compare regional performance,
3. Analyze product-level trends and;
4. Identify high-value customers.

OBJECTIVE

Using raw csv files containing information about transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories.

I have to use Power BI Desktop to:

1. Connect and transform the raw data so that they can be accessed to build a data model.

2. Build the relational data model that summarizes the above data 

3. Create calculated columns and measures with DAX and;

4. Lastly, design an interactive dashboard to visualize this data and use this model to generate meaningful insights.

Solution
This is an advanced level power bi project. In this project, I have used Power Bi to create a data model for Adventure Works. I normalised all the data available in the Csv files. Once normalised, I connected the data using primary keys. Then I created the relevant calculated columns and measures which I could add to my dashboard. These calculated columns and measures were built usinf DAX queries. 
After creting the measures, I began the visualization part where I built four dashboards of visualization. These are- an executive dashboard that showed an executive summary, a dashboard showing product level summary, a map view and lastly a dasboard showing customer level summary. I created custom tool tips too. Lastly I created a navigation pane and few quick links that would enable the user to access relevent data easily from the dashboard.
